 TOday, I had a haircut after almost 2 and half months. I wanted this soo bad. Looked like shit all the time. Covid is almost dead and feels good to be out
 and about in the world. The life seems to be in a lot of control. 
 
 I wonder why I find it so difficult to let you go in my mind. The unique pairing combinations that I have in my mind with you, seem to keep pulling me back.

 This long time of fighting kind of gave me the hope that we could make the things right. Had you voiced your requirements clearly rather than hiding them
 under the unecessary fights, it would have been easier for me to resolve them. I did resolve them finally but I guess you dint like the way I felt for you
 . You thought that I was desperate and this is fucked man. 
 
 
 I should have gone non contact with you earlier.
