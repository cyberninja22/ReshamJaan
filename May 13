Every passing day feels worse man. I am not a simp. This simp shit is killing me. 
I am losing my self confidence trying to love you. You meant so much to me. I think, being that emotionally weak at the time made you reasses the time
you spent with me and decide to move on. 
You never loved me, you were just looking for somethings that you wanted in a man. And you judged me on my weakest time of the life. I was stupid, I admit
but did not deserve to be done like that. I just have so much to say and write it out here. This feels like shit man. 
Dude, all the love, attention, care and shit that I gave you meant nothing to you. I guess, it was all about feeling safe and secure with me. 


This long distance thing, definitely did not help and I hsould have visited you and communicated my love to you whiel I was there. You meant so much to me and 
now that you're gone. This hole in the heart is too much to carry. I should have been with you my girl. I should not have waited so long to commit to you. 
You were everything that I wanted, in my life. Now that you're gone. This feels so upsetting and shitty.
