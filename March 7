Came across this repo again while sorting out stuff ofr Harppreet to prepare for his interview. 

I just feel ki how things ended with her. Kaash we had a timemachine where I coould connect with her and explain her all the things that were going on that led
for this disaster. I miss her mental presence man. I msiss her so much. 

BC I started this repo, dint know this would end like this. I want to spill off my mind for my own clarity and to help her understand what I actually feel about 
her. I will write what I feel one day.
