Still a fcuking night, Feel calm. want you by my side. I dont know why you did not have it in you to have me by your side. WE had been wroking on this 
relationship for almost 9 months! may se
and this had to end up like that. I never understood why you felt that I was not ready to commit. If I dint have it in me, then why would I 
spend so much time w you. Investing so much time in us. 

The end was really nasty, I should have kept writing the diary like I promised to write when I had that tremendous attraction to you in the first
place and which was true. I still feel that we are meant to be together. Mera to kisi pe man bhi nahi karta. Nahi karra tha. 
Maybe I could have handled the situation better and would have focussed on something else tabhi, leking thik hai yaar. Dekhte hai abhi kya
karna hai aur kaise karna hai. Bebu, miss you a lot. 

I know this will make you you feel like powerful,since you're the the one who moves on quickkly and doesnt care at all 

Unlike all your previous boyfriends, I never left you sleeping on ntthe floor alone while you were tired, Dint cheat you on your birthday. Dint leave 
you to die alone and go party. I think, wo end me that I was acting emotionally and stuff turned you off and lead to this. Tujhe yaad hai ki you 
kept reminding me ki; I will be the one to leave you and not the other way around and I kept assuring you ki aisa kuch nahi hai. 



But on that night when you said, I was the worst, kitna ganda laga. You were treating me like shit and saying stuff. I can understand that you need tom 
make me a villian in your head to make the transition easy for you and move on guilt free. 


Bottom line is that I just want you to come bakc to me and live a nice life togther. The way we planned in it initially. I will make it happen.
