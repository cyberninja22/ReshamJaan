There is so much to wrriite about you. Thiis makes my mind go hayward. 
Kitna kuch hai man me, kya exactly likhu samajh me nahi aa raha hai. All I want ot do is forget you and unlove you. But I dont seem to do that. 
I dont know why my anxiety and the panic got the best of me and I could not exactly express that I wanted to have a relationship with you the next time 
around. 
This seems to be, lost on you. You got angry and were not listen to me. 

Whenever I imagine you, my chest has a restless feeling. 

I want to move on and close this chapter but I sometime get the hopes that I will get back w you. This seems impossible. Eventhough you might never 
readd this note. I always thought you wouldd be the one reading this when I die or get old. Looks like that isnt going to happen. 
This happened with mee the llast time I didnt want to speak to you. It was back in August. This time I wantedd to stop myself and give you some space
to thiink and then I get hit by the hammerrr. I am sorrry forr this multiple typoo. Thiis is my mallfunciioniing keyboard. I odnt know how long thiis 
shit is goign to happend, i wish to publish the life and then this happens. 

You've ddone enough --gorgon city. I wish too keep typing until Ii am at a loss off woords and I dont have anytihng to type and everrything about you 
is dead insidde me. Whiich looks like is going to take time. I always wonderr rhow you had the time
